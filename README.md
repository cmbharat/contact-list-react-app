# The Contacts List App

Contact List App is contact management App which fetches and displays user data from the API, allows users to add new contacts, update existing ones, and remove contacts. This comprehensive feature set makes it an invaluable tool for organizing and maintaining a contact list, providing a smooth and user-friendly experience.

+ Fetch and Display User Contacts: The React.js Contact List App fetches user data from API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and displays it in an organized and user-friendly manner. The app utilizes the API to retrieve contact information, including names, emails and dynamically renders it on the interface. Users can effortlessly browse through the list of contacts, making it convenient to access essential information.

+ Add and Update Contacts: This Contact List App enables users to add and update contacts directly from the application. By leveraging the POST and PUT API calls, the app allows users to create and modify contact entries. Adding a new contact triggers a POST request to the API (this is a dummy call). Similarly, updating an existing contact triggers a PUT request(this is a dummy call).

+ Contact Deletion: In This React.js Contact List App Users can easily remove contacts from the list by initiating a DELETE request to the API (this is a dummy call).
